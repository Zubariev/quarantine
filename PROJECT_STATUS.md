# Quarantine Game: Production Readiness Analysis

This document provides an analysis of the current state of the Quarantine game and outlines what needs to be added or modified before the game is ready for production deployment.

## Environment Configuration

### API Keys to Replace
- **Stripe Keys**: Replace placeholder values with actual keys in environment files
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Frontend publishable key
  - `STRIPE_API_KEY`: Backend secret key (keep secure)
  - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Set up webhook in Stripe dashboard and use the generated secret

### Base URLs and Endpoints
- Update base URLs in API configurations (frontend)
- Configure proper webhook endpoints for Stripe on production environment

## Assets Required

### Audio
- **Background Music**: Already implemented in `/frontend/public/audio/bgm/`
  - ✅ Morning, afternoon, evening, and night themes
- **Sound Effects**: Already implemented in `/frontend/public/audio/sfx/`
  - ✅ Click, error, meal, notification, success sounds

### Images
- **Event Images**: Already implemented in `/frontend/public/images/events/`
  - ✅ Food discount, friend call, noise, package, power outage
- **Missing Assets**:
  - Shop item images for products (furniture, plants, food, etc.)
  - Character customization options
  - Background/room variations
  - Loading/transition screens

### UI Elements
- **Components**:
  - ✅ Basic UI components implemented (LoadingSpinner, ErrorMessage)
  - Need: Toast notifications styling refinement
  - Need: Confirmation dialogs for critical actions
  - Need: Achievement notifications
  - Need: Progress indicators for timed activities

## Features Implementation Status

### Core Mechanics
- ✅ Daily scheduling system
- ✅ Time progression system 
- ✅ Stats system (hunger, stress, tone, health, money)
- ✅ Basic activity system
- ✅ Shop and inventory system
- ✅ Monetization backend and frontend
- ⚠️ Event system partially implemented

### Missing Features
1. **User Progress**:
   - Save/load game state
   - Achievements system
   - Progress tracking
   - Game history/statistics

2. **Game Balance**:
   - More activities with varied effects
   - Balance economy (income vs. expenses)
   - Difficulty progression

3. **Content**:
   - More random events
   - More shop items
   - Expanded storylines

4. **Social Features**:
   - Friend interactions
   - Leaderboards
   - Item gifting

## Technical Debt

### Backend
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement rate limiting for API calls
- Add validation for all input fields
- Add comprehensive logging
- Implement caching strategies

### Frontend
- Add loading states for all async operations 
- Improve responsive design for mobile devices
- Implement proper form validation
- Add unit tests for critical components
- Optimize bundle size

### Testing
- ✅ Basic E2E test framework in place
- Need more comprehensive test coverage
- Need automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Need performance testing

## Database Schema Needs

- Users table already implemented in Supabase
- Game progress table needs optimization
- Inventory indexing for better performance
- Statistics aggregation tables for analytics

## Deployment Checklist

### Infrastructure
- Set up production environment
- Configure CDN for static assets
- Set up database backups
- Implement monitoring and alerting

### Security
- ✅ Updated gitignore to exclude environment files
- Set up proper CORS configuration
- Implement rate limiting
- Set up IP blocking for abuse prevention
- Regular security audits

### Performance
- Implement asset optimization pipeline
- Set up database query optimization
- Configure proper caching strategy
- Load testing before production release

## Documentation Needed

- User guide/tutorial
- Admin dashboard documentation
- API documentation for future integrations
- Monetization strategy documentation

## Monetization Readiness

- ✅ Stripe integration implemented
- ✅ In-game purchases implemented
- Need A/B testing framework for conversion optimization
- Need analytics for purchase funnels
- Need refund policy and process

## Marketing Assets Needed

- App store screenshots
- Promotional videos
- Social media assets
- Press kit

## Post-Launch Plan

- Analytics setup for usage tracking
- Feature roadmap for updates
- Community feedback mechanisms
- Support system implementation

## Priority Action Items

1. Replace placeholder environment variables with real values
2. Complete the missing shop item assets
3. Finalize game balance (economy, difficulty)
4. Implement save/load functionality
5. Add comprehensive error handling
6. Set up production deployment infrastructure
7. Implement analytics for tracking game metrics
8. Create user documentation/tutorial

This document should be treated as a living reference and updated as the project progresses.
